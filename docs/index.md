# Getting started
Scar is an interpreted programming language made in Java, which has all major
features all programming languages should have. Scar is neither practical nor fast,
but serves its purpose: teaching the creator how to make lexers, parsers, interpreters and so on. 

!!! error
    The documentation is ahead of development, some documented features are yet to be implemented

## Installation
The only way to run scar scripts is to clone the repo, start Shell.java and use the built-in run() function to run .scar files.  
There will be a CLI tool in te future for running scripts.
