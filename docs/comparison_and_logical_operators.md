# Comparison & Logical Operators
Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for `true` or `false`.


## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

| Operator | Description           |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `==`     | equal to              |
| `!=`     | not equal             |
| `>`      | greater than          |
| `<`      | less than             |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal |
| `<=`     | less than or equal    |

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `and`    | logical AND |
| `or`     | logical OR  |
| `not`    | logical NOT |
